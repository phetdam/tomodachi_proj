Was originally the working project folder for BAC Insight Team's project on crime in Chicago, but due to some issues with data set, we have changed our project to using panel data on songs extracted from the Spotify API to predict a song's danceability. Our goal is to see which features are relevant for predicting danceability, and to create models that could be used to recommend automatically construct a playlist of Spotify songs to dance to at the club or other venue.

You may find the data [here](https://www.kaggle.com/snapcrack/the-billboard-200-acoustic-data) on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). Stay tuned for more.
